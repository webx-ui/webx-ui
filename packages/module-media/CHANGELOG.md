# @webx-ui/module-media

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9e1b513: Three things found by putting the library on S3 behind a CDN.

  The image editor could not open a picture at all. It draws onto a canvas and writes that canvas
  out, which a browser refuses for bytes fetched from another origin without CORS headers — and a
  private bucket cannot be given those headers for the panel in any case. So `webx-ui/module-media`
  serves the picture itself at `files/{id}/source`, behind the same permission as the listing, and a
  `MediaFile` now says where that is. `url` stays what everything that only looks at a file uses.

  The editor also spoke English in a Russian panel: it is a component of the design system, so its
  words are props, and the manager was not passing any. It has its own ten-language group now, as
  does the question the card asks before deleting one file.

  `@webx-ui/admin`: changing the language renames the sections too. Titles are translated on the
  server and travel in the manifest, which was fetched in the previous language — so the panel used
  to switch everything except its own navigation until the page was reloaded.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 47cc998: The file manager after an hour with it: icon actions instead of labelled buttons, filters behind
  popovers, folders in a drawer on a phone, case-insensitive search in any alphabet, previews that
  change when a picture is edited, and a copy-the-link that says whether it worked.

  `@webx-ui/admin` gains the toaster the panel never had — until now every `toast()` from every
  module reported into silence.

- 47cc998: New package `@webx-ui/module-media`: the file manager as a section of the panel, a picker that
  opens from code, and a form field that keeps `{ path, alt, title }` on the entity rather than on
  the file. Batch deletion moved to `POST files/delete` on the server, because the panel's own HTTP
  client sends no body on `DELETE`.
- 47cc998: A second pass over the file manager, from using it: upload refusals written in extensions rather
  than a paragraph of mime types, a status bar under the grid instead of a toolbar that grows a
  line, folders created through a dialog rather than a `prompt` the browser may refuse, the page in
  a card, and the image editor cropping what the person actually framed.

  `@webx-ui/core`: `WxFileCard` falls back to the old clipboard when the modern one refuses, so the
  green tick appears wherever the copy actually worked.

### Patch Changes

- 47cc998: Three things the file manager got wrong in Russian: the dialogs' buttons stood shoulder to
  shoulder, the confirm button read `manager.save` because nobody had shipped the key, and an
  upload refusal came back in English — the uploader is a bare `XMLHttpRequest` and was the one
  request in the panel that never said which language it was drawn in.
