## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 738a7e9: The screen's own bar along the bottom, and a preview that fills the height it was given.

  A screen's buttons live in its head, and since the page started scrolling natively the head goes
  with it — so a form long enough to need saving is a form whose save button is off the top of the
  window by the time it is needed. `WxActionBar` is that button brought back: the state of the work
  on the left, what can be done about it on the right.

  It is part of the screen rather than of the shell — a list has none, a form has one — and it is
  the last row of the screen rather than a layer over it. That is why it never covers anything: at
  the end of a page it is the last thing on it, and above that it sticks to the bottom of the window
  without taking the room it would need to be there. `--wx-action-bar-bottom` is how far off the
  edge it stops, and the strip below it is painted over, or the page scrolling past would show
  through the gap.

  `WxMain` gives a screen that holds one a floor of `--wx-fill-height`, so a form of one field still
  has its bar along the bottom of the window rather than halfway up the page.

  In the panel: the settings screen and the block type editor duplicate the buttons from their
  heads, and the page editor — which is exactly as tall as the window, so nothing ever scrolls away
  — moves `Save` and `Publish` into the bar instead of repeating them, leaving the head the links
  out to the site.

  The page preview inside the block constructor now fills the card it stands in. A scaled iframe
  keeps its layout height, so a page 1280px wide drawn in a 420px column used to paint a third of
  the card and leave the rest empty for the card to scroll; the frame is now divided by its own
  scale, and what scrolls inside it is the site. On a form that scrolls, the tree and the field
  panel are sticky with their own scrollbars, the way the preview beside them already was.

### Patch Changes

- 2e27380: Lists that mean what they show: a tree stays a tree, a row promises only what it does, and
  anything that cannot be undone asks first.

  **The page tree is a table at every width.** Below 640px it used to become cards, and a card has
  no indentation to read and no chevron to open — so the section quietly asked the server for a flat
  list instead, and a phone had no tree at all. The cards were the mistake, not the tree. The table
  now drops columns as the width goes: when it was last touched, then what state it is in, then
  where it lives, until a row is its title and its `···`. Measured at 375px: 65px a row against
  250px a card, ten pages on screen instead of three and a half, with the chevron still opening
  branches.

  **`WxTable` takes a `clickable` prop.** It still infers the answer from whether anybody listens
  for `row-click`, which is right for an ordinary list and needs nothing said. It is not right for a
  list whose rows stop leading anywhere while it is on screen — the bin of `Pages`, an archive, a
  picker taking several rows at once — because the listener a component was rendered with cannot be
  read again. `:clickable="false"` withdraws the whole promise: no pointer, no highlight, and no
  `row-click` either. The bin, the two SEO lists for a reader who may not edit them, and the
  administrator picker in multiple mode all say so now.

  **One place decides what a failed request says.** `useErrorText()` turns an error into a sentence
  in the panel's language. A 422 is repeated word for word — every refusal that reaches one is
  written by a module to be read — and every other status gets the panel's own words, so clicking a
  page somebody else deleted says "It is not there any more" rather than
  `No query results for model [WebxUi\Pages\Models\Page] 8`. Twenty-odd places that printed the
  server's `message` now go through it, and `webx-admin::errors` ships the lines in ten languages.

  **Confirmations, in numbers.** Restoring from the bin, publishing a page, moving a branch by drag
  or by the "Inside" picker, deleting a block that holds others and deleting an empty media folder
  all ask now, and the question carries the consequence as a figure: how many pages come back, which
  address the page starts answering at, how many addresses a move rewrites, how many blocks go with
  the one being removed. A move of a single page stays a gesture and asks nothing, because a redirect
  is left on every address a move vacates — there is no undo to offer, only a second move.

- 738a7e9: One step for the whole panel: cards, grids and forms read `--wx-gap`

  The panel's spacing step — 8 on a phone, 12 on a tablet, 16 on a desktop — used to space the
  frame alone. It now spaces everything: the air inside a card and between the things in it, the
  gap between the fields of a form, the gutter of a grid, the space between the strip of tabs and
  what it switches. Where there is no panel around them, the components fall back to 16, which is
  what they had.

  Two things change on their own account. A form's `gap="md"` is 16 rather than 24, so a form laid
  out by a card and a form laid out by itself finally agree. And a tab is now a column that spaces
  what it holds — two cards in a tab used to stand flush and read as one.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- d792e56: Republish so the dependency on `@webx-ui/module-admin` names the version that has `WxScreen`.

  The first version of the package was published by hand, before the release bumped the frame, so
  the tarball froze `^0.3.1` — a range that excludes the 0.4.0 which introduced `WxScreen`. Installs
  picked a nested copy of the older frame and the app failed to build on the missing export.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 47d52ee: Screens in the panel, both halves, and the first section built on them.

  - `module-admin` (PHP): `Screens::register` / `Screens::extend`, the `FieldTypes` registry with the core types, `ScreenValues` (save by description — a key the tree does not name is dropped, a node without permission is closed for writing, rules per type and per language), `GET /api/cms/screens/{name}` (patched, permission-filtered, translated). The manifest carries `screens`, `groups` and each module's `group`; `Module::group()` is new on the contract (`AbstractModule` answers null). `webx-admin.groups` declares the `system` group.
  - `@webx-ui/module-admin`: `createAdmin({ screens, types })`, `WxScreen`, `admin.loadScreen()` cached per language, `admin.types`, navigation groups drawn as branches — "System" holds settings and administrators.
  - `module-media`, both halves: registers `wx-media` (the field on the client, the stored key with the resolved address on the server).
  - `module-settings`, both halves, new: the `settings.index` screen with one "General" tab, `cms_settings`, `GET`/`PUT /api/cms/settings`, `settings()` on the site, cache and `SettingsSaved`, MCP `settings_list` / `settings_get` / `settings_set`. The SEO tab is a project patch, not part of the module.
  - `core`: a `gear` icon; the language chip on a localized field unrolls every language in the site order — the current one included and marked — instead of reshuffling, and switching puts the caret into the field that was switched.
  - `module-auth`: the administrator implements `HasPermissions`, `cms.auth` makes the guard the request's default, and the section sits in the "System" group.
